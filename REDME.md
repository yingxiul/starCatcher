To run this file, you should have numpy,CV2 and PIL installed. Besides, you need a camera~

1. Go to line 724 and change file location to where you save the bomb image.

 2.Go to line 826 and line 830 and change the file location to where you save the records.txt.

Now you will be able to ran the program.

Note: the program will detect corners from the whole image captured by camera, thus the unity of the background would make the corner detection more presice. Thus, I suggest you take a board(any color you like), put it in front of the camera and let it be the background. The bar should be any color which is different from the board color. For more set up instruction, go to the video~
